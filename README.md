# HackerNews

A Xamarin.Forms app for displaying the top posts on Hacker News.

This app uses the [Text Analytics API](https://aka.ms/cognitive-services-text-analytics-api) from [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://aka.ms/myvcp0) to analyze the sentiment of each headline. If a headline is happy, 😃 will appear. If a headline is sad, ☹️ will appear. If a headline is neither happy nor sad, 😐 will appear.
